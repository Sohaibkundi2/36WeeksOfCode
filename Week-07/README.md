# ðŸ“¦ Week 07 â€“ State Management in React

## ðŸ—“ Topics Covered

### âœ… Week 7.1 â€” Prop Drilling & Context API
- **Prop Drilling**: Passing data from parent to child, even if it's not needed at every level.
- **Problem**: Becomes messy and hard to manage in large apps.
- **Context API**:
  - Helps share global data (like theme, user info) without prop drilling.
  - Uses `createContext`, `Provider`, and `useContext`.

### âœ… Week 7.2 â€” Context API & Recoil
- **Limitations of Context API**:
  - Not great for frequent updates or many different pieces of state.
- **Recoil Introduction**:
  - A state management library made for React.
  - Uses **atoms** (state units) and **selectors** (derived/computed state).
  - Great for scalable and fast state management.

### âœ… Week 7.3 â€” Recoil Deep Dive
- **Selectors**:
  - Compute values from atoms (like uppercase name).
- **Async Selectors**:
  - Fetch data from APIs (e.g. user profile, todos).
- **Recoil Dev Tools**:
  - Helps debug your state.
- Learn about:
  - `useRecoilState`
  - `useRecoilValue`
  - `useSetRecoilState`
  - `atom effects` (e.g. syncing with localStorage)
