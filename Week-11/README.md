# Server less FNS

- Serverless doesn't mean there are no servers ,  it means you donâ€™t manage the servers.

- Serverless Function is a small backend function that runs in the cloud only when triggered, and automatically scales.

- For example, in traditional way, you need to create a server with express js. host it somewhere like heroku etc and need keep running 24/7 hours. But with Serverless Functions, you only write the function, and the cloud provider runs it only when needed.
