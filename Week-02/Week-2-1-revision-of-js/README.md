# Week 02 – Async JavaScript Deep Dive 🚀

Welcome to Week 02 of my 36-week coding journey! This week focuses on diving deeper into asynchronous JavaScript concepts like callbacks, promises, and async/await.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

### Week 2.1 | Revision Of Promises, Async JS

- **Understanding Callbacks**  
  A function passed as an argument to another function. Useful for handling asynchronous tasks like reading files, fetching APIs.

- **Asynchronous Functions**  
  JavaScript is single-threaded, but with async operations like setTimeout, fetch, etc., it performs non-blocking operations.

- **Promises**  
  Represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It has three states: Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected.

- **Promisified vs. Non-Promisified Functions**  
  Non-promisified: Use callbacks.  
  Promisified: Return a promise so we can use `.then()` / `.catch()` or `async/await`.

## 💡 My Learnings

- Understood the difference between callback hell and promise chaining.
- Learned how to use `async`/`await` to write cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
- Practiced converting callback-based code to promise-based.
