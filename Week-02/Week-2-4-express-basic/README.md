# Week 2.4 – Express (Basics) 🚀

Welcome to Week 2.4 of the 36-Week Web Dev Journey! In this week, we're diving into the **world of Express.js**, one of the most popular frameworks used in backend development with Node.js. Let’s explore the core concepts that power modern web servers. 🔥

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🧠 JavaScript Concepts
- **Single Threaded Nature of JS**  
  JavaScript runs on a single thread using the event loop, handling tasks asynchronously without blocking the main thread.

---

### 🌐 HTTP & Express Basics
- **What is an HTTP Server?**  
  A server that handles incoming HTTP requests and sends back responses (HTML, JSON, etc.)

- **What is Express?**  
  A lightweight Node.js framework to build web applications and APIs efficiently.

- **Types of Methods**  
  - `GET` – Fetch data  
  - `POST` – Send data  
  - `PUT` – Update data  
  - `DELETE` – Remove data

- **Creating a Basic HTTP Server & Routes**
  Use Express to define endpoints (`routes`) like `/`, `/about`, `/users`, etc.

- **Handling Input in HTTP Servers**
  - Accept query parameters (`/search?q=sohaib`)
  - Accept data from `body` in POST requests

---

### 🔄 Request & Response

- **Request (`req`)**  
  Contains data from the client like params, headers, body, etc.

- **Response (`res`)**  
  Used to send back data to the client (HTML, JSON, status codes).

---

### 📬 Status Codes
Common status codes include:
- `200 OK` – Success  
- `201 Created` – Resource created  
- `400 Bad Request` – Invalid request  
- `404 Not Found` – Resource not found  
- `500 Internal Server Error` – Something went wrong on the server

---

### 🧪 What is Postman?
A GUI tool to test HTTP APIs by sending requests and viewing responses easily, great for debugging and development.
