# Axios vs Fetch:

### Step 1: What Are Axios and Fetch API?
- Axios is a third-party library (you install it via npm or yarn) that helps you make HTTP requests easily.

- Fetch API is a built-in browser API that lets you make HTTP requests without installing anything.

### Step 2: Browser & Environment Support
- Axios works in all modern browsers and Node.js (server-side JavaScript).

- Fetch API is built into modern browsers but not supported natively in Node.js (you’d need a polyfill or package).

### Step 3: Installation
- Axios requires you to install it (npm install axios).

- Fetch API is built-in — no installation needed.

### Step 4: Syntax (How You Write the Code)
- Axios uses simple and clean syntax.

- Fetch API is a bit more verbose and you need to handle some things manually.

### Step 5: JSON Handling
- Axios automatically converts JSON response data into JavaScript objects.

- Fetch API requires you to manually call .json() on the response to get the data.

### Step 6: Error Handling
- Axios automatically treats HTTP status codes like 404 or 500 as errors you can catch.

- Fetch API does not throw errors for HTTP errors by default; you have to check the response’s ok status manually.

### Step 7: Extra Features
#### Axios supports:

- Request and response interceptors (lets you modify requests/responses)

- Cancelling requests easily with cancellation tokens

- Setting request timeouts

- Easier file uploads with multipart/form-data

#### Fetch API:

- Supports request cancellation via AbortController (more manual)

- Does not have built-in timeout support—you have to add custom logic

- File uploads need manual configuration

### Step 8: Example Comparison
#### Axios example:

```js
axios.get('/api/data')
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
  ```
#### Fetch example:

```js

fetch('/api/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
  ```
### Step 9: When to Choose Which?
#### Choose Axios if:

- You want easy syntax and automatic handling of JSON and errors.

- You need advanced features like interceptors, request cancellation, or working in Node.js.

#### Choose Fetch API if:

- You prefer to use built-in browser APIs without extra dependencies.

- Your requests are simple, and you don’t need advanced features.

- You want to keep your project lightweight.
